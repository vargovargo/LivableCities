#Organizing Leadership

### The [original 'white paper'](https://github.com/vargovargo/LivableCities/blob/master/LivableCitiesOriginal.md) informing this work was produced more than a yeago and has been promoted by the directors of 4 UW Institutes.

+ [Jonathan Patz](http://ghi.wisc.edu/person-types/leadership/#5020) - [Global Health Institute](http://ghi.wisc.edu/)
> __Jonathan initially established contact with the most engaged donors for the initiative__. 'Livable Cities' is also one of the four priority areas for the Global Health Institute, which Jonathan directs. GHI has received small gifts to pursue the development of this initiative and fund an internal (UW) grant process around Livable Cities. 

+ [Paul Robbins](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/director.php) - [Director, Nelson Institute](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/index.php)
> During Jonathan's sabbatical, __Paul has assumed a primary leadership role in guiding the discussion with donors__. 

+ [Craig Benson](http://sustainability.wisc.edu/about/leadership/craig-benson/) - [Office of Sustainability](http://sustainability.wisc.edu/)
> Craig has been involved in some of the first larger meetings around Livable Cities, including helping to craft the initiatl idea.  In the most recent meetings with the interested donor, he hasn't been engaged. 

+ [Mike Corradini](http://energy.wisc.edu/about/energy-experts/michael-corradini) - [Wisconsin Energy Institute](http://energy.wisc.edu/)
> Mike was at the August Livalble Cities meeting with David Ward. Mary Blanchard is the primary person who would be working on the initiative.

Among several important leads, Deb has fostered connections to the [UW Arts Institute](http://www.arts.wisc.edu/artsinstitute/) and local arts community to think about opportunities for Livable Cities to engage and embrace the arts. 

+ [Joel Rogers](http://www.cows.org/staff-page/joel-rogers) - [Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS)](http://www.cows.org/)
> __Joel has only recently been engaged by Livable Cities leadership.__ He and COWS' experience and connections to political leaders and municipal administrators – as well as their perspective on urban process and change – is invaluable to the Initiative. Joel was introduced to Livable Cities through Tracey when they worked together on the EPA ACES grant proposal.  Julie Snyder invited him to attend DMI Dinner in November 2014. Jason, Deb, and Julie followed up with Joel for breakfast on December 1, 2014.
